# Natural Language Processing With Cryptocurrency
## Emma Steuer

### For Ellie:

I have four main goals I'd like to get accomplished next semester: 

- 1. Develop a web page to input user's desire's to see certain cryptocurrency's predictions (I will add a sketch of what I'm hoping for it to look like.)

- 2. Delve deeper into machine learning and the math behind it. I don't want to just put inputs into a model and receive outputs. Ideally, I'd like to understand multiple machine learning models and be able to understand what I'm working with better than I do right now.

- 3. Experiment with the best 'features' to input into my models, whether it's tweet polarity, likes, length, etc. 

- 4. Find other inputs for my models including news headlines and Reddit. 

Because tweets are often correlated with cryptocurrency prices, I think it would be beneficial to get a Twitter research API account so we can pull unlimited tweets. The requirements are here: [Twitter Research API](https://developer.twitter.com/en/products/twitter-api/academic-research). We need to prove we are either "masterâ€™s student, doctoral candidate, post-doc, faculty, or research-focused employee at an academic institution or university" and we also have to have "a clearly defined research objective, and you have specific plans for how you intend to use, analyze, and share Twitter data from your research." Clearly my model has already made good progress in regards to accuracy with such a small number of inputs, so if we could have many more it could improve accuracy greatly, especially when I get further into future prediction models.
